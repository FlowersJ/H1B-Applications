# H1B-Applications
Predicting H1B Applications. This was done as a final project for our Data Mining course at University of Chicago in Spring of 2019. 
Data Mining acts as a broad overview course that introduces students to clustering, feature reduction techniques, some plotting, 
feature engineering/data manipulation as well as cleansing, andmachine learning models. Project reflects that.
